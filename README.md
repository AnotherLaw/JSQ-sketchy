# JSQ-sketchy
A Javascript + jQuery sketch exercise project following vague instructions by [The Odin Project](http://www.theodinproject.com/web-development-101/javascript-and-jquery?ref=lnav).

## What we're trying to achieve

  - Initialise a 16 by 16 grid of square divs with JS/jQuery
  - Set a hover effect so that the grid is coloured as the pointer passes over it
  - Add a button to clear the current grid, prompt user for a new grid which utilises the same space
